    Name: ReplPad  ; !!! seems needed to get into system/modules list
    Options: [isolate]  ; user redefinitions of IF, etc. can't break the REPL!

    Description: {
        This file originated as the first .reb code file that was fetch()'d
        over the web and run in a browser.  It has been an ongoing process to
        try and start factoring the reusable bits out of this into some kind
        of library which other programs can use.

        HOWEVER--!--the *near-term* (2020) goal for this project is to improve
        the console itself into an online tutorial and demo for the system.
        This is not to say that making a web framework for arbitrary Ren-C
        programs in WebAssembly isn't interesting.  Just that it is a vast task
        which needs to be approached in a measured way.

        Hence improving the contents of this file and running other programs
        from it using DO is a preferable alternative to trying to factor its
        functionality out too early...
    }

    Notes: {
        * Use `debugger;` for programmatic breakpoints in JavaScript code.

        * This project uses contentEditable on purpose, in order to leave room
          in the future for richer formatting than a TEXTAREA would provide.
          It may seem annoying considering it generally does only monospace
          in the code parts...but that's just one application.
